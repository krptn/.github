# Krptn

A user authentication and access management system (IAM) with [Zero Knowledge security](https://www.krptn.dev/news/zero-knowledge/). It is available as a python extension module.

How we achieve this?

- All Data is encrypted (any data can be request by the developer to be secured)
- Only the appropriate users' credentials can unlock the cryptosystem (this protects you from server-side attacks)

This gives you without ever needing to even notice it! It protects you from server side attacks.

## Features

- Secure Storage of Data
- User Authentication
- FIPS Validated Cryptography (via OpenSSL 3)*
- Secure memory wiping
- FIDO Passwordless*
- Integration with popular web frameworks
- Zero-Knowledge encryptoin

\* FIDO (passwordless) does not use FIPS validated resolvers
